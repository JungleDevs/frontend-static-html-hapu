# Jungle Devs - Frontend Challenge #001

  ## Description
  **Challenge goal**: The goal of the present challenge is to acquire and consolidate knowledge on HTML (a markup language) and CSS (a stylesheet language) by using them both to create a static webpage (no iterations with the user, show a display of content) based on a provided design.
  
  **Target level**: This is an entry level course, no prior knowledge of programming is needed.
  
  **Final accomplishment**: By the end of this course you'll be able to create static webpages using HTML and CSS. A webpage completely done by scratch based on a predefined design.
  
  
  ## Resources
  **Design**: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/fdncF938AXrCMjOFw1n483/Frontend-%E2%80%93-Challenge-1B)
  
  
  ## Acceptance criteria
  * Have HTML and CSS split in two files:

  * Every change you make to your HTML or CSS you'll need to refresh your webpage on your browser.
  
## Additional Information
  * Right click on your webpage and click on inspect to open the dev tools that will help your work. Use the elements tab (or inspector on firefox) to check the HTML and CSS you're applying to your webpage;
  * Not all HTML and CSS features work on all browsers. For more information, you can check on Can I Use if the feature is supported (https://caniuse.com/);
